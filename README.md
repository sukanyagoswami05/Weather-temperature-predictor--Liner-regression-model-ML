# Weather-temperature-predictor--Liner-regression-model-ML
ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts weather temperature based on historical data using Linear Regression.
The goal is to understand how temperature varies with different features and to apply supervised learning techniques to make accurate predictions.

This project demonstrates:

Understanding of data preprocessing (cleaning, handling missing values, feature selection).

Application of Linear Regression for predictive modeling.

Use of Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² Score.
